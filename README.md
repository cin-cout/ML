# Machine-learning-Games

Implement several games by designing the rules, and training the ML models to pass the games through repeatedly modifying the rule. 

There have 3 different games in the MLGame-master:

* arkanoid

* pingpong

* snake


## Building and Usage


See the README in the MLGame-master and file of each game, such as Machine-learning-Games/MLGame-master/games/arkanoid/. It will teach you how to build the environment and run the game in different way in detail. 

## See want I did
Design the rules, and train the ML models to pass the games through repeatedly modifying the rule. 

The following are the places my programs at:
* Machine-learning-Games/MLGame-master/games/arkanoid/ml/
* Machine-learning-Games/MLGame-master/games/pingpong/ml/
* Machine-learning-Games/MLGame-master/games/snake/ml/


## Shortcut

If you want to see the result quickly, follow the steps bellow.(You might install the module first such as Python, Pygame, Pickle)

```
cd MLGame_maste
```

```
python MLGame.py -f 200 -i ml_play.py -i ml_play.py pingpong HARD 5
```
